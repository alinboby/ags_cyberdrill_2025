## The Storyteller's Secret

A simple text file was found on a compromised workstation. It contains what appears to be a short fictional story. However, your red team suspects that the attacker used steganography within the textâ€”possibly hiding sensitive data or a passphrase within the words, lines, or formatting of the story.

Your job as part of the SOC/Blue Team is to:

    Read the content carefully.

    Analyze the text for hidden data using both manual inspection and steganography tools.

    Extract any hidden message, code, or instructions embedded within the file.

    Report your findings and recommend how to detect and mitigate such techniques in the future.

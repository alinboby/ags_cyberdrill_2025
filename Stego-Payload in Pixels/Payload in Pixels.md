## Payload in Pixels

A seemingly harmless image file was discovered in an employee’s downloads folder during a routine endpoint inspection. At first glance, it appears to be an ordinary picture. But your SOC team suspects that a secret file is embedded within the image—possibly a payload used for data exfiltration or malware delivery.

Your mission as part of the forensic response team is to:

    Examine the image using forensic tools and techniques.

    Determine if the image contains a hidden file.

    Extract the embedded file using steganography or file-carving techniques.

    Analyze the extracted content to understand its purpose.

    Document your process and provide mitigation steps to detect similar threats.

## The Dots of Deception

During a routine sweep of the server room, a suspicious printed note was found near an employee's desk. The paper contains a series of raised dots. Initial scans show that it may contain encrypted information or instructions.

Your security team suspects it's a form of covert communication used to bypass digital monitoring.

Your mission is to:

    Identify and translate the encrypted characters into readable text.

    Analyze the decoded message for any encryption or coded instructions.

    Determine if the message points to a security breach or insider activity.

    Document your process and recommend how to detect or prevent such physical covert channels in the future.

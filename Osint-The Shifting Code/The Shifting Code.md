## The Shifting Code

Your company's Data Loss Prevention (DLP) system triggered multiple alerts showing that a developer repeatedly modified and uploaded source code outside the approved channels.
It appears the developer was changing the code versions slightly each time to avoid detection.

Your security team's job is to:

    Analyze the captured source code snippets flagged by DLP.

    Compare the different versions to identify what was changed, added, or hidden across updates.

    Investigate the version control system to track the commit history and understand the full picture.

    Determine if the developer was attempting to leak sensitive logic, introduce a backdoor, or hide malicious code.

    Document the findings and suggest improvements for source code monitoring and insider threat detection.

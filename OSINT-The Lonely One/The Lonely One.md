## The Lonely One

A threat actor under the alias "liveoverflow" has been leaving digital footprints on various coding platforms. While their profiles are mostly clean, your SOC team discovers an odd clue: on one platform, liveoverflow has only one follower—and that account seems inactive at first glance.

However, intelligence reports suggest that this lone follower might be in possession of a secret code related to an ongoing cyber operation.

Your mission as the OSINT analyst is to:

    Investigate the follower’s profile and activity across platforms.

    Correlate any usernames, repositories, or linked accounts to uncover hidden data.

    Extract the secret code, possibly embedded in a repo, gist, commit message, or bio.

    Report your findings with full documentation of your OSINT methodology.

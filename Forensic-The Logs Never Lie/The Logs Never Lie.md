## The Logs Never Lie

After a suspicious incident involving unauthorized access to a critical server, your forensic team collected a copy of the Windows Event Log file (.evtx) from the system.

Initial scans show multiple login attempts, privilege escalation events, and possible malware execution—but the timeline is unclear.

Your mission is to:

    Analyze the provided .evtx file for key events like logins, process creation, and security policy changes.

    Reconstruct the attack timeline — when and how the system was compromised.

    Identify the attacker’s activities and persistence mechanisms

    Report the findings with event IDs, timestamps, and relevant user accounts involved.

    Recommend how to improve event log monitoring and response processes.

## The Encrypted Bait

Your SOC team intercepted a phishing email sent to multiple employees. At first glance, the email looks like a typical phishing attempt with urgent language and a suspicious attachment. However, deeper inspection shows that the email body or attachment contains encrypted information, not just simple malicious links.

Your mission is to:

    Analyze the phishing email headers, body, and any attachments.

    Identify the method of encryption used.

    Attempt to decrypt the hidden information to reveal any commands, payloads, or next-stage instructions.

    Determine the attackerâ€™s objective and the risk posed by the encrypted payload.

    Document the full analysis with screenshots, tools used, and mitigation steps to prevent similar phishing attacks.

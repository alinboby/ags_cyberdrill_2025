The Distorted Code

During a physical security inspection, a suspicious QR code sticker was found posted near the entrance of your company’s office. However, the QR code looks partially distorted—some parts are smudged, blurred, or modified.

Your security team believes the QR code might lead to a hidden URL, secret message, or even trigger a malicious action.
The distortion was likely an attempt to make detection harder while still allowing certain scanning apps to decode it.

Your mission is to:

    Analyze the distorted QR code carefully.

    Recover or reconstruct the original QR code if needed.

    Extract and interpret the hidden information or destination.

    Report your findings with screenshots and methods used.

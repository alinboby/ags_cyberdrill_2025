## Secrets in the Spam

Your email security filter flagged a series of spam emails that appeared to be typical junkâ€”random subjects, odd wording, and strange formatting. However, your SOC team's deeper review suggests that some of these emails were intentionally crafted to carry encoded secret messages hidden inside the spam content.

The spam uses techniques like unusual encoding, hidden characters, or pattern-based steganography.

Your mission is to:

    Analyze the spam emails carefully for hidden or encoded content.

    Identify the encoding or obfuscation method used

    Extract and decode any hidden messages or instructions.

    Assess the purpose of the secret communication

    Document your findings and suggest how to strengthen defenses against advanced spam-based covert channels.

## Into the Dark

During an investigation, a completely black image file was recovered from a suspect’s device. At first glance, it appears to be blank—no visible content or metadata. However, intelligence suggests the file contains a hidden secret code vital to uncovering the next stage of a planned cyber attack.

Your task as the digital forensic analyst is to:

    Analyze the image using forensic tools and techniques.

    Identify any hidden data.

    Extract the secret code or message concealed within the image.

    Document the tools used, steps taken, and your conclusions.
